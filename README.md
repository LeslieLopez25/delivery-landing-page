<h2>A website created using HTML, SASS, and JavaScript.</h2>

<p>This website created using HTML, SASS, and JavaScript to show the and close the navbar, change background header, link active, scroll animation reveal, and a light and dark theme toggle to change the themes as well. I created this following the tutorial of Bedimcode. I added an auto update for the copyright date. Screenshots of the website.</p>
